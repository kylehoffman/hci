        Throughout the semester, we completed several projects (called Design Sprints) that emphasized different parts
        of the human-centered design process. Many of these are referenced in my Design Manifesto, but I provide links
        to all of them here.

        <p>
          In this project, we learned how to use Figma to design websites and applications. Specifically, we redesigned 
          the website of a local furniture and interiors store, called Knotty & Board. As this was our first project 
          this semester, it allowed us to become acquainted with the design process holistically. Our main focus was 
          on sketching and design.

        <div class="project-date">October 14, 2025</div>
        <p>
          This project focused parimarily on data visualization. We worked to visualize a dataset about coffee quality and
          production around the world. Our project contains two visualizations: a persuasive visualization and an analytical one.
          In terms of technical skills, this project taught us the basics of web development and data visualization.

            In this project, we got to combine the skills gained from our first and second Design Sprint assignments to
            build a web-based VR simulation. Hence, this project honed our web development skills and allowed us to
            dip our feet in VR development. We relied primarily on A-frame to build the VR experience, as well as
            360-degree photography.

            This project had a different flavor from our other Design Sprint assignments because our final submission
            was a physical prototype rather than a digital one. Nonetheless, I particiularly appreciate this because
            during the prototyping phase of any project, physical prototypes offer a tangible experience with a design 
            which might not otherwise be possible. In particular, this project allowed us to develop further our ideation,
            prototyping, and revision skills in the human-centered design process.
