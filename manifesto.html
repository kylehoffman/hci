        <h2>My Design Manifesto</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Human-centered design is an umbrella term containing many different design principles that share the same core idea: making humans the focus of the problem-solving process. It can be applied to a plethora of different projects, including website design, app design, game design, physical tool design, or even construction blueprints. In my Human Computer Interaction class at Davidson College, I worked on many different projects involving computer technologies and learned how to incorporate human-centered design principles into them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through my HCI course, I learned to use a variety of technologies for producing and designing computer projects. Even more importantly, I developed and refined my own human-centered design process. There are five key components of my process; they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Needfinding</li>
            <li>Ideation</li>
            <li>Prototyping and Revision</li>
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <li>Technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I will explain each of these components and cite references to projects I worked on throughout the semester to further elucidate them. Although not all these categories seem directly related to humans, I will explore how my design process links them intrinsically to humans.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Needfinding</h3>
        <p>
            The foundation of the human-centered design process is determining the problem you are trying to solve. Moreover, if a problem needs to be solved, that implies you are trying to help someone! Amy J. Ko summarizes this nicely, "the essence of understanding any problem is communicating with the people... so that you can experience the diversity and complexity of problems they face, and partner with them to address them" (<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/understand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read here for more</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Without deeply understanding the problems which the community you want to help faces, you cannot effectively design something which solves those problems. That's why connecting with the people you are trying to help before generating ideas or prototyping is invaluable.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my class, this was the focus of our second homework assignment. I interviewed three different people (one, a young student, two, a middle-aged mother, and three, a disabled veteran) to understand the diverse needs of people who interact with the healthcare system.
        </p>

        <figure style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <img src="interview1.jpg" alt="A student sitting on a couch beside a coffee table and a lamp during a Needfinding interview" class="manifesto-img">
            <figcaption class="photo-caption">The young student whom I interviewed for homework 2</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            These interviews ultimately allowed me to understand the healthcare system and its flaws from different perspectives. Later, when ideating and designing my application, I kept these different perspectives in mind and tried to address them with my design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way that Needfinding keeps the design process human-centered is by connecting designs to the emotions of the community they aim to help. During my interviews, instead of asking simple yes-or-no questions, I tried to evoke stories from my interviewees, which shed more insight into the problems they had. The Institute of Design at Stanford offers a <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2021/wi/readings/FIELDGUIDE-Screen-DTBC-March-2015-V2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good framework for this</a>, featured below:
        </p>

        <figure style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <img src="anatomyOfInterview.png" alt="A graph whose axis is time (of the interview) and emphasizes the importance of evoking stories and exploring the emotions of your interviewees" class="manifesto-img">
            <figcaption class="photo-caption">The Anatomy of an Interview, which keeps the design process focused on emotions and stories</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Reaching out directly to the community you are trying to help through a conversation, watching them work, or becoming a part of their community keeps the people at the center of your design process. That is why Needfinding is the most foundational component of the design process. Remember that before even beginning your prototype or ideation phase, you need to deeply understand the problem you want to solve. The best way of doing that is by communicating directly with the people you seek to help.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>
            After you understand the problem you want to solve, the next step is to brainstorm ideas for your design. This is known as ideation. Ideation provides more structure for building your prototype by giving you a targeted plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am often tempted to go with my first idea and develop it robustly, but it is better to ideate extensively first. A top design firm, IDEO, exemplifies this: "if you don't bring at least 5 ideas to every ideation meeting, then you won't last as a designer." That is why IDEO's Rules for Brainstorming includes "Go for quantity" (see <a href="https://cs374-spring-2018.netlify.app/classes/08-Ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here for more</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            In our class, we modeled this ideation process. For example, in our <a href="https://medium.com/@ellora03/design-sprint-3-design-for-another-world-e433ecd5021f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third Design Sprint assignment</a>, we began our ideation process by generating many ideas on sticky notes. We would then decide which of our ideas we liked the most and refine our idea with a thorough sketch.
        </p>

        <figure style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <img src="stickyNotes.png" alt="Six blue sticky notes, each with written text describing a different idea for a VR simulation's design" class="manifesto-img">
            <figcaption class="photo-caption">A collection of sticky notes with ideas for developing a web-based VR simulation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            In our <a href="https://medium.com/@ellora03/design-sprint-4-re-design-and-extend-60aa4a1fcf80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth Design Sprint assignment</a>, we used a whiteboard to produce a "final" sketch of the prototype we would later design. To see these steps of the ideation process, see the figures below:
        </p>

        <figure style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <img src="whiteBoardSketch.png" alt="A sketch on a whiteboard of a square partitioned into sections for designing a room with furniture arrangements" class="manifesto-img">
            <figcaption class="photo-caption">The whiteboard containing the final sketch of a web-based, interactive room design application</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The combination of these ideation approaches is reminiscent of the one outlined in the <a href="https://kawilliams.github.io/teaching/hci/papers/Roberts-HeadleandRitsos-FiveDesignSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Design-Sheet Methodology</a>. Our sticky notes are like Sheet 1, in that we explored a variety of ideas, and our final whiteboard sketch is like Sheet 5: the refined basis of our design.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Design Sprint 3, our implementation had a lot of bugs (for example, editing the 360 images with AI caused visual artifacts and one of our environments was missing a button to return to the home screen). However, our design still received the most votes in our class. I believe this was due to our focus on generating deviant ideas and thorough planning. Although implementation might be more technically difficult than ideation, this shows that a collection of good ideas is equally as important as a good implementation!
        </p>
        <p>
            During the ideation phase, it is also important to always keep in mind the information you gained about your problem during the Needfinding phase. Remember that the ideas you develop for your sketches should strive to address the needs of the users you identified in Needfinding.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Prototyping and Revision</h3>
        <p>
            After the ideation phase, it's time to start building! But, importantly, as Ko says, "prototyping isn't strictly about learning to make things, but also learning how to decide what prototype to make and what that prototype would teach you" (see <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). I will emphasize that it is important to learn from building your prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my course, we had different opportunities to learn from our prototypes through peer feedback. We presented our designs in class in two different modalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lecture-style presentation at a projector</li>
            <li>Science fair style interactive presentations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Generally, I found the science fair style presentation to be a lot more efficient, fun, and engaging. It also gave my peers more time to offer quality feedback as they interacted directly with my designs. For our VR implementation in Design Sprint 4, our peers gave valuable feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some scenes were too bleak or lacking in variety</li>
            <li>Adding sound effects tailored to each season would enhance immersion</li>
            <li>Shorten the time to transition between scenes</li>
            <li>Implement a progress indicator (like a loading bar)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To keep the prototyping and revision human-centered and related to the Needfinding phase (and in a similar style to this science fair style presentation), designers can perform usability testing, where a researcher asks a participant to perform tasks and listens for behavior or feedback (more <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Furthermore, if you are designing for a specific community that you interviewed in the Needfinding phase, this is the best time to return to that community to allow them to test your product and give more feedback!
        </p>

            <figcaption class="photo-caption">The construction of our physical prototype from Design Sprint 4 (the same design as the whiteboard sketch)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <br>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the design process, it is important to keep accessibility in mind. Accessibility is important because it aims to make products and knowledge accessible to all people and hence is a core component of human-centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our second Design Sprint, we designed a website, <a href="https://mafajardo23.github.io/coffeeworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee World</a>, to visualize coffee data from around the world. We used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE</a> (web accessibility evaluation tool) in order to ensure that our website was accessible to keyboard-only users and users with visual impairments. Similarly, on our <a href="https://medium.com/@kyhoffman/surfing-the-digital-world-via-tab-c0252f4217cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth homework assignment</a>, which was focused on accessibility, our professor required that our blog posts included URLs, annotations, captions, and alt text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because humans are diverse, to serve humans, our designs must account for a diversity of lived experiences. We do not want to design for only one type of human. That is why accessibility is also a core component of human-centered design.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the course, I learned a variety of different technologies including Figma (for website and application design), web-development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and AI tools (like A-frame). Learning all these tools in just one semester was difficult, highlighting again that implementation can be more difficult than ideation. But again, this means that our ideas and the problems we are trying to solve are equally (if not more) important than their implementations, as I saw in Design Sprint 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, because we ultimately use technology in the human-centered design process, it is important to constantly brainstorm ways to use these technologies to integrate the other four components of Needfinding, Ideation, Prototyping and Revision, and Accessibility. One way I did this on homework 2 was by using Zoom to conduct one of my interviews, but this is only one way to do so.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my time in HCI, I developed skills related to all parts of the human-centered design process. I have also developed my own intuition for how to systematically design a product using human-centered design principles, which I have outlined in this manifesto. The main components of this process are Needfinding, Ideation, Prototyping and Revision, Accessibility, and Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, when designing something for others, the most important thing is to always keep those people on your mind during the design process. No matter what stage of design you are in, there will be a way to serve your target audience. This is the core of human-centered design.
